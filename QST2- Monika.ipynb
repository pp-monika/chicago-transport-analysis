    "Urban planning is an important aspect of designing cities to meet the infrastructure needed to support the livelihood of tens of millions of residents. Transportation in particular has a critical impact on people’s decision to accept employment, how they spend their time, places they visit, and even business locations. This exploration of Chicago taxi and ride share service data will provide an insight on traffic conditions, travel expenses, and hotspots for visitation in the city which can be used for city planning purposes."

    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "This project aims to analyze Chicago’s taxi and rideshare data from 2018 to 2023 to generate actionable insights that support urban planning, enhance traffic management, and optimize transportation services. By identifying peak demand zones, assessing traffic congestion effects on trip durations, and analyzing fare trends across variables such as time, location, and service type, the project seeks to provide data-driven recommendations to improve mobility, reduce congestion, and better meet the transportation needs of Chicago’s residents and visitors."
